## SKINKARE (Artificial Intelligence-Based Early Detection of Stunting Application through Machine Learning Methods)

Project Description:
SKINKARE, which stands for Stunting Kids INsight via Camera & Artificial Intelligence for Recovery, is an innovative stunting detection system that utilizes a camera to scan children’s height through MediaPipe and processes the data using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for height estimation. The predicted height is then combined with anthropometric data such as weight, age, and gender, and analyzed using the Random Forest algorithm and Z-Score classification based on Indonesia’s national child growth standards. This approach allows SKINKARE to automatically classify stunting risk levels, and efficient early detection.

```

Import the Database

```bash
  Make sure you have MySQL and phpMyAdmin installed. then:
    1. open http://localhost/phpmyadmin
    2. Create a new database named skinkare
    3. Go to the import tab
    4. Upload the file skinkare.sql (provided in this project)

## Usage

* Open the homepage in your browser.
* Click the “Tambah Anak” , fiiling the form and klik scan button to begin the scanning process.
* Capture or upload the child’s full-body image using the camera.
* The system detects the child’s height automatically using MediaPipe and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.
* Input additional anthropometric data such as weight, age, and gender.
* The system processes the combined data using a Random Forest algorithm and Z-Score classification, based on Indonesia’s national child growth standards (Permenkes No. 2 of 2020).
* After analysis, the result page displays:

  * Stunting classification result (Normal or At Risk)
  * Growth visualization graph based on Z-Score
  * Personalized recommendations for prevention and action steps according to the child’s risk level
* Users can view their examination history for monitoring progress over time.
* Health workers can access the admin dashboard to review, manage, and analyze all recorded data.
